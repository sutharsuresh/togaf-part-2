Please read this scenario prior to answering the question.
Your role is consultant to the Lead Architect within a multinational company that manufactures electronic components. The company has several manufacturing divisions located worldwide and a complex supply chain. After a recent study, senior management have stated a concern about business efficiency considering the company's multiple data centers and duplication of applications.
The company has a mature Enterprise Architecture (EA) practice and uses the TOGAF architecture development method in its EA practice. In addition to the EA program, the company has several management frameworks in use, including business planning, project-portfolio management, and operations management. The EA program is sponsored by the CIO.
A strategic architecture has been defined to improve the ability to meet customer demand and improve management of the supply chain. The strategic architecture includes the consolidation of multiple Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) applications that have been operating independently in the divisionsâ€™ production facilities.
Each division has completed the Architecture Definition documentation to meet its own specific manufacturing requirements. The enterprise architects have defined a set of work packages that address the gaps identified. They have identified the value produced, effort required, and dependencies between work packages to reach a target architecture that would integrate a new ERP environment into the company.
Because of the risks posed by change from the current environment, the architects have recommended that a phased approach occurs to implement the target architecture with several transition states. The overall implementation process is estimated to take several years.
Refer to the scenario.
You have been asked what the next steps are for the migration planning.
Based on the TOGAF standard which of the following is the best answer?

**You assess how the Implementation and Migration plan impacts the other frameworks in use in the organization. Minimally, you ensure that the plan is coordinated with the business planning, project/portfolio management and operations management frameworks. You would then assign a business value to each work package, considering available resources and strategic fit. You then use the work packages to identify projects that will be in the Implementation and Migration Plan
