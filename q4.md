You are working as an Enterprise Architect within the Enterprise Architecture (EA) team at a healthcare and life sciences company. The EA team is developing a secure system for researchers to share clinical trial information easily across the organization and with external partners.

Due to the highly sensitive nature of the information, each architecture domain must consider privacy and safety concerns. The healthcare division has been directed to minimize disruptions to clinical trials while introducing the new system gradually.

How would you identify the work packages for introducing the new system? Based on the TOGAF standard, which of the following is the best answer?

**Use a Consolidated Gaps, Solutions, and Dependencies Matrix to classify each solution, group them into work packages, then regroup into Capability Increments. Document in an Architecture Definition Increments Table.**
