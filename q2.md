You are the Chief Enterprise Architect at a large food service company specializing in sales to trade and wholesale for example, restaurants and other food retailers.

One of your company’s competitors has launched a revolutionary product range and is running a very aggressive marketing campaign. Your company’s resellers are successively announcing that they are not interested in your company's products and will sell your competitor’s.

The CEO has stated there must be significant change to address the situation. He has made it clear that new markets must be found for the company’s products, and that the business needs to pivot, and address the retail market as well as the existing wholesale market.

A consideration is the company’s ability and willingness to change its business model, and if it is a temporary or permanent change. An additional risk factor is one of culture. The company has been used to a stable business with a reasonably well known and settled client base - all with its own local understandings and practices.

The CEO is the sponsor of the EA program within the company. You have been engaged with the sales, logistics, production, and marketing teams enabling the architecture activity to start. An Architecture Vision Architecture Principles, and Requirements have all been agreed. As you move forward to develop a possible Target Architecture you have identified that some of the key stakeholders' preferences are incompatible. The incompatibilities are focused primarily on time-to- market, cost savings, and the need to bring out a fully featured product range, but there are additional factors.

Refer to the scenario -

You have been asked how you will address the incompatibilities between key stakeholder preferences.

Based on the TOGAF standard which of the following is the best answer?
**
You would use the Architecture Vision, Principles, and Requirements to define a set of criteria for
alternatives and create a set of architecture views to illustrate the impact of the alternative Target
Architectures. You would identify the impact on planned projects. You would understand the strengths
and weaknesses of the alternatives. You would conduct a formal stakeholder review to decide which
alternative to move forward with. You will determine the funding required.**
